### Intimex

At Intimex Network Technology Co., Ltd., I was responsible for migrating a.NET e - commerce system to the Java ecosystem and reconstructing it into a microservice architecture with tenant - based design for the business platform, which saved maintenance costs. I integrated multiple payment service providers, unified the SDK interface, and used RabbitMQ and WebSocket for functions like order push and customer service chat. During promotional activities, I integrated Sentinel for module rate - limiting. 

### Guangdong Haihong

When I worked at Guangdong Haihong Electric Co., Ltd. as a full - stack developer, I reconstructed the database architecture, used Sharding JDBC for horizontal table partitioning, reducing the single - table data volume from tens of millions to millions. I also optimized the data collection module with Netty, shortening the interface response time from seconds to milliseconds and configured read - write separation for Sql Server. 

### Lontranx

At Lontranx Technology Co., Ltd., I developed the EFT payment platform and its backend support system. I connected mainstream payment channels such as Alipay, WeChat Pay, UnionPay, and Octopus. I designed a SaaS - based CRM backend for multiple merchants, achieving functions like merchant transaction statistics, payment record tracking, and POS machine access. The daily transaction volume covered more than 100,000 transactions. I designed a batch data processing framework using Spring Batch, integrated multiple data sources of Oracle and PostgreSQL, and achieved a data consistency of 99.9%. I also reconstructed the payment core module with Vert.x, adopting an asynchronous non - blocking architecture to significantly improve the TPS of the payment interface and concurrent processing capabilities. 

### Topsoon

During my internship at Guangzhou Shouxin Technology Co., Ltd., I participated in the development of the Smart Education Government Platform. I was involved in requirements analysis and completed the backend development based on the SSM framework. On the front - end, I used LayUI, Bootstrap, and Ext.js. I designed a smart scheduling module for Foshan Physical Education High - School Entrance Examination, developed a data visualization dashboard, and was in charge of system deployment, writing user manuals, and customer training. I'm passionate about programming and committed to a long - term career in software development. I believe my skills and experience make me a suitable candidate for this position, and I'm looking forward to contributing to your team. Thank you!

### Sharding JDBC

When using Sharding-JDBC for table partitioning, the following issues need attention: 

1. Data Distribution Strategy 
   - **Hash Algorithm Selection**:    - If you use a hash algorithm for data distribution, ensure that the hash function evenly distributes data across different tables. For example, when hashing user IDs, if the hash function is poorly designed, some tables may receive a large amount of data while others have very little, leading to data skew.    - Consider the scalability of the hash algorithm. As the number of tables increases, the original hash algorithm may need to be adjusted to maintain a balanced data distribution. 
   -  **Range - based Partitioning**:    - When using range - based partitioning (such as partitioning by date), define reasonable range boundaries. For instance, if partitioning an order table by order date, set the range intervals according to the actual business volume. If the intervals are too large, it may lead to uneven data distribution; if they are too small, it may result in excessive table creation.    
   -  Be aware of future data growth trends. If your business is growing rapidly, the initial range settings may become inappropriate over time, and you may need to re - partition the data. 

2. Database Compatibility - **SQL Compatibility**:    - Sharding - JDBC may have some limitations in supporting certain complex SQL statements. For example, some advanced window functions or recursive SQL may not work as expected after sharding. Test your SQL statements thoroughly in the sharded environment to ensure they can be executed correctly.    - Some database - specific features may not be fully supported. For instance, if you are using a database with unique storage engines or special indexing mechanisms, Sharding - JDBC may not be able to fully utilize them in a sharded scenario. - **Database Version**:    - Different versions of databases may have different behaviors when used with Sharding - JDBC. Make sure that the database version you are using is compatible with the version of Sharding - JDBC. Some database features or bug fixes in new versions may affect the performance or functionality of Sharding - JDBC. 

3. Transaction Management - **Local vs. Distributed Transactions**:    - Sharding - JDBC supports local transactions within a single data source. However, when a transaction involves multiple shards (distributed transaction), more complex transaction management solutions are required. You need to choose an appropriate distributed transaction framework, such as Seata, and configure it correctly to ensure data consistency across multiple shards.    - Understand the performance impact of distributed transactions. Distributed transactions usually have higher overhead compared to local transactions due to the need for coordinating multiple data sources. Design your business logic to minimize the scope of distributed transactions as much as possible. - **Transaction Isolation Level**:    - The transaction isolation level you choose can affect the consistency and concurrency of your data. In a sharded environment, ensure that the selected isolation level is appropriate for your business requirements. For example, a higher isolation level like `SERIALIZABLE` can provide strong data consistency but may reduce concurrency, while a lower level like `READ COMMITTED` may have better performance but may introduce some data consistency issues. 
4. Index Design - **Global Index vs. Local Index**:    - When creating indexes in a sharded environment, decide whether to use global indexes or local indexes. Global indexes can provide a unified view across all shards but may have performance and maintenance challenges. Local indexes are specific to each shard, which can improve query performance on individual shards but may require more complex query processing when retrieving data across multiple shards.    - Consider the query patterns of your application. If most queries are focused on a single shard, local indexes may be more appropriate; if queries often need to access data from multiple shards, global indexes may be necessary. - **Index Fragmentation**:    - As data is inserted, updated, and deleted in the sharded tables, index fragmentation may occur. Regularly monitor and optimize indexes to maintain good query performance. This may involve operations such as rebuilding indexes or reorganizing data. 
5. Maintenance and Monitoring - **Data Migration**:    - In the future, you may need to adjust the sharding strategy, such as adding or removing shards. Plan for data migration in advance. Develop a reliable data migration plan to ensure that data can be migrated smoothly between shards without data loss or corruption.    - Test the data migration process thoroughly in a test environment before applying it to the production environment. - **Performance Monitoring**:    - Set up a comprehensive performance monitoring system to track the performance of Sharding - JDBC, including query response time, resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O), and network traffic. Analyze the monitoring data regularly to identify performance bottlenecks and take appropriate measures to optimize the system.    - Monitor the health status of each shard, including database connection status, disk space usage, and replication status (if applicable).
